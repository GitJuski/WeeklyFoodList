# WeeklyFoodList ðŸ«š

This is a hobby project I'm building for my household to use. I wanted create a service that shuffles foods and picks something to eat every week. And since I've been into coding as a side hobby lately, I decided to give this a try. I wanted to understand how backend and frontend go together which is why I'm trying to create a Django backend with JavaScript frontend.

I decided to upload this into my GitHub mainly for "backup" and documentation purposes because the project is at a point where it kinda works. It's not secure or polished by any means but I'll will be adding some features I'd like this project to have and maybe try to learn about securing fullstack projects.
